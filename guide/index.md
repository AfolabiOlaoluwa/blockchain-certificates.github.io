## Introduction

Blockcerts is an open initiative for building apps that issue and verify blockchain-based certificates for academic credentials, professional certifications, workforce development, and civic records. 

Blockcerts consists of open-source libraries, tools, and apps enabling a decentralized, standards-based, recipient-centric ecosystem, enabling trustless verification through blockchain technologies. 

Blockcerts uses and encourages consolidation on open standards. Blockcerts is committed to self-sovereign identity of all participants, and enabling recipient control of their claims through easy-to-use tools such as the certificate wallet. Blockcerts is also committed to availability of credentials, without single points of failure.

These open-source repos may be utilized by other research projects and commercial developers. It contains components for creating, issuing, viewing, and verifying certificates on the blockchain. These components form all the parts needed for a complete ecosystem.

### Example Deployments

The following examples illustrate issuer-hosted certificates, so the verification button appears beneath the certificate. While consumers would ideally employ their own verifier, issuers may self-host certificates with a verification button included. Below are four examples below:

*   The Media Lab issued digital certificates to Media Lab alumni who attended the Lab's 30th anniversary in October 2015\. [Check out the certificates here.](https://coins.media.mit.edu/)
*   Learning Machine issued HR certificates to all of its employees. Check out an example certificate [here](https://hr.learningmachine.com/13dfa9c6-ced9-4693-875a-ed131d51e502).
*   MIT's Global Entrepreneurship Bootcamp issued digital certificates to the students who attended their workshop in Seoul, South Korea in March 2016\. [Check out the certificates here.](http://certificates-bootcamp.mit.edu/)
*   The Laboratorio para la Ciudad issued digital certificates to participants of a week-long workshop in Mexico City in September 2015\. [Check out the certificates here.](http://certs.labcd.mx/)
