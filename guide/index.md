## Introduction

These open-source repos form a working standard for blockchain certificates that may be utilized by other research projects and commercial developers. It contains components for creating, issuing, viewing, and verifying certificates using the Bitcoin blockchain. These components form all the parts needed for a complete ecosystem.

Please note that this standard is not attempting to solve identity. In other words, this solution does not certify the mapping of public keys to individuals or organizations. However, this ecosystem does form the basis for making strong proof of claims.

### Design Principles

*   Open source
*   Reliance on open standards
*   Open participation
*   Recipient control
*   Simplicity
*   Minimize resource requirements (computation, cost, etc.)
*   Solution must be viable without any proprietary product
*   Blockchain-agnostic in the long term
*   Maximize confidence in the end product

### Example Deployments

The following examples illustrate issuer-hosted certificates, so the verification button appears beneath the certificate. While consumers would ideally employ their own verifier, issuers may self-host certificates with a verification button included. Below are four examples below:

*   The Media Lab issued digital certificates to Media Lab alumni who attended the Lab's 30th anniversary in October 2015\. [Check out the certificates here.](https://coins.media.mit.edu/)
*   Learning Machine issued HR certificates to all of its employees. Check out an example certificate [here](https://hr.learningmachine.com/13dfa9c6-ced9-4693-875a-ed131d51e502).
*   MIT's Global Entrepreneurship Bootcamp issued digital certificates to the students who attended their workshop in Seoul, South Korea in March 2016\. [Check out the certificates here.](http://certificates-bootcamp.mit.edu/)
*   The Laboratorio para la Ciudad issued digital certificates to participants of a week-long workshop in Mexico City in September 2015\. [Check out the certificates here.](http://certs.labcd.mx/)
