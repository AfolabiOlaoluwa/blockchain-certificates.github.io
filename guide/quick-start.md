## Quick Start

The easiest way for developers to get familiar with Blockchain Certificates is to clone the [cert-viewer](https://github.com/blockchain-certificates/cert-viewer) repo and perform the “quick start” installation steps. The Docker image will minimize the steps involved. After this, you will be able to view and verify certificates locally.

Next, you might try issuing sample certificates. The Docker image allows you to experiment with issuing certificates without the risk of spending money. Clone the [cert-issuer](https://github.com/blockchain-certificates/cert-issuer) repo and perform the “quick start” installation steps.

Each of our github repositories has detailed information; start with the README.md for each. Most of the code is in python, and we’ve provided the following entry points, as appropriate:

*   pypi packages for reusable libraries
*   Docker files for quick start
*   Flask services or CLI for local runs
