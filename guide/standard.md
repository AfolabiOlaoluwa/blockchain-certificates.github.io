## Standards Alignment

The Blockcerts community is aligned with (and contributing to) the following standards:

* Open Badges
* W3C Verifiable Claims
* W3C Linked Data Signatures
* W3C / Rebooting Web of Trust Decentralized Identifiers

Blockcertsâ€™ open-source components conform to the above standards, demonstrating how such standards can be used in a viable system. This includes generating solutions for subtle difficulties arising in a real-world system, including:

* revocation of certificates
* identity of participants in a decentralized, self-sovereign mode
* other lifecycle concerns, including key management

### Design Principles

*   Open source
*   Reliance on open standards
*   Open participation
*   Recipient control
*   Simplicity
*   Minimize resource requirements (computation, cost, etc.)
*   Solution must be viable without any proprietary product
*   Blockchain-agnostic in the long term
*   Maximize confidence in the end product
